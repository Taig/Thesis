\section{Identifying the problems}

In order to create a documentation that contains the answers necessary to make \textit{Scala on Android} a smooth experience, it was first necessary to discover the questions. Having previously worked with \textit{Scala on Android} intensively, I gained a rough overview of the difficulties that a developer faces. To broaden this picture it was necessary to collect data of developers that also made experiences in this field.

\subsection{Researching technique}

In preparation for this task the first step was to identify an appropriate data-gathering technique, deciding between qualitative and quantitative research. The small size of the \textit{Scala on Android} community was a strong indicator for quality based research. Obtaining a reasonable sample size for quantitative researching methods would fail at the scope of the potential target group. Furthermore, qualitative research is a suitable technique when \enquote{investigators are interested in understanding the perceptions of participants} \cite[p. 72]{berg01} whereas quantitative methods are used when \enquote{researchers have clear ideas about the type of information they want to access and about the purpose and aims of their research} \cite[p. 72]{berg01}. Therefore qualitative research is the technique of choice for the purpose of revealing difficulties in dealing with the \textit{Scala} programming language on the \textit{Android} platform.

Since the development community is scattered across the globe I had to find ways to find and reach out to potential peers to then conduct a remote interview.

\subsection{Finding interview partners}

I planned to promote my intentions on relevant community platforms (such as \textit{reddit/r/scala}, the \textit{Scala} and the \textit{Scala on Android} mailing lists) hoping to reach a diverse target group. If this approach failed I intended to contact developers that were actively committing in this area on \textit{GitHub} directly.

My postings on the community portals enjoyed a surprisingly great popularity and enabled me to win 5 individuals over, willing to tell me about their development experiences.
