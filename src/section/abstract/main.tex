\section*{\centering{Abstract}}

The aim of this bachelor's thesis is to promote and advance the \textit{Scala} programming language on the \textit{Android} platform as an alternative to \textit{Java}. Enjoying the benefits of \textit{Scala on Android} is often circumvented by the numerous obstacles that its integration into the \textit{Android} platform entails. Solving these issues is not impossible, but difficult---due to the lack of documentation.

For this very reason, this thesis is dedicated to the creation of a comprehensive, web-based documentation which simplifies working with \textit{Scala on Android}. At first, it is necessary to identify the obstacles that developers are facing with the technology. By means of qualitative researching methods, developers are interviewed in order to reveal the particular problems they have been confronted with. The next step then is to create a sophisticated web-based documentation that provides guidance through the challenging topics of \textit{Scala on Android}.

As a result of these efforts, the finished documentation is publicly available at \url{http://scala-on-android.taig.io/}.
